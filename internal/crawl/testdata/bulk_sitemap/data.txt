Operating since 1982 on Bear Creek, upstream of its confluence with the South Platte River in suburban Lakewood, Colorado, it is the third of three “tri-lakes” dams built by USACE to collectively reduce risks from flooding in the Denver metropolitan area. When not operating to reduce flood impacts, USACE manages water releases from this tri-lakes system for recreation, water quality, and to support fish and wildlife.  The dam consists of an earthen embankment, an outlet structure for releasing stored water, and a spillway over which excess water can flow during times of extreme runoff from rain and snowmelt. During normal operations, the outlet structure releases water to downstream users and flows are generally less than 100 cubic feet per second (cfs) (one cubic foot of water is equal to 7.5 gallons). As operations shift to reducing flood risks during periods of high runoff, the outlet structure is used to manage reservoir elevations and can release up to 2,100 cfs. When reservoir levels from extreme storms or snowmelt exceed the outlet structure’s release capacity, water can flow through the spillway to reduce the likelihood of water flowing over the embankment (overtopping), which can lead to dam failure, or breach. The spillway was designed to additionally pass  up to 153,500 cfs. This large but controlled, intentional flow is called a “non-breach” release. The reservoir has never been high enough for spillway flow.  For perspective, the largest release of water from Bear Creek Dam as a result of flooding was approximately 800 cfs from the outlet structure in 1980. It is important to understand that the dam is designed to release far more water when necessary and these large releases can occur with minimal to no warning, even with warning systems in place.","gsp:hasGeometry":{"@type":"http://www.opengis.net/ont/sf#Point","gsp:asWKT":{"@type":"http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#wktLiteral","@value":"POINT (-105.13389 39.65083)"}},"schema:geo":{"@type":"schema:GeoCoordinates","schema:longitude":-105.13389,"schema:latitude":39.65083},"schema:subjectOf":[{"@type":"schema:Dataset","schema:identifier":"Outflow","schema:name":"Outflow in Cubic feet per second","schema:provider":{"@type":"schema:GovernmentOrganization","schema:url":"https://water.sec.usace.army.mil/cda/reporting/providers/projects?fmt=geojson","schema:name":"US Army Corps of Engineers"},"schema:variableMeasured":{"@type":"schema:PropertyValue","schema:description":"Outflow in Cubic feet per second","schema:unitText":"cfs","schema:name":"Cubic feet per second"},"schema:publisher":{"@type":"schema:Organization","schema:name":"Internet of Water","schema:email":"internetofwater@lincolninst.edu"}},{"@type":"schema:Dataset","schema:identifier":"Inflow","schema:name":"Inflow in Cubic feet per second","schema:provider":{"@type":"schema:GovernmentOrganization","schema:url":"https://water.sec.usace.army.mil/cda/reporting/providers/projects?fmt=geojson","schema:name":"US Army Corps of Engineers"},"schema:variableMeasured":{"@type":"schema:PropertyValue","schema:description":"Inflow in Cubic feet per second","schema:unitText":"cfs","schema:name":"Cubic feet per second"},"schema:publisher":{"@type":"schema:Organization","schema:name":"Internet of Water","schema:email":"internetofwater@lincolninst.edu"}},{"@type":"schema:Dataset","schema:identifier":"Elevation","schema:name":"Elevation in Feet","schema:provider":{"@type":"schema:GovernmentOrganization","schema:url":"https://water.sec.usace.army.mil/cda/reporting/providers/projects?fmt=geojson","schema:name":"US Army Corps of Engineers"},"schema:variableMeasured":{"@type":"schema:PropertyValue","schema:description":"Elevation in Feet","schema:unitText":"ft","schema:name":"Feet"},"schema:publisher":{"@type":"schema:Organization","schema:name":"Internet of Water","schema:email":"internetofwater@lincolninst.edu"}},{"@type":"schema:Dataset","schema:identifier":"Flood Storage","schema:name":"Flood Storage in Acre-feet","schema:provider":{"@type":"schema:GovernmentOrganization","schema:url":"https://water.sec.usace.army.mil/cda/reporting/providers/projects?fmt=geojson","schema:name":"US Army Corps of Engineers"},"schema:variableMeasured":{"@type":"schema:PropertyValue","schema:description":"Flood Storage in Acre-feet","schema:unitText":"ac-ft","schema:name":"Acre-feet"},"schema:publisher":{"@type":"schema:Organization","schema:name":"Internet of Water","schema:email":"internetofwater@lincolninst.edu"}}]}
